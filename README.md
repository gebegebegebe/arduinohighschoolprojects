# cranecarhybrid
This code was the code of our final project in high school.
This project is basically a hybrid between a crane and a car.
This robot has 2 motor wheels with one free wheel which will 
support the robots movement. The crane itself has 4 degrees 
of freedom and with the combination of the movement granted 
by the motors it can pick objects up from any place on the 
ground.

This project was a collaborative effort between:
Yosavath Otniel
Darian Soetanto
Gabriel Kaunang

and a special mention to our IT teacher Ronny Laluyan for his
supervision.
